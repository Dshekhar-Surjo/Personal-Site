                <h3>Beyond Academia</h3>
                <!-- CHANGE: Update with your personal interests -->
                <p>Outside of research, I am an avid harmonica trainee and enjoy performing solo music on the road. Music provides a creative counterbalance to my analytical work.</p>
                
                <p>I also enjoy hiking in the nearby mountains and have developed an interest in cave painting. These outdoor activities help me maintain perspective and often provide unexpected moments of insight into research problems.</p>
                
                <p>I believe in maintaining work-life balance and encourage my aquintances to pursue interests outside their academic work. Reading contemporary fiction and playing chess are other pastimes that keep my mind engaged in different ways.</p>
